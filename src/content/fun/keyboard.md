# Split Ortho Keyboard (Corne)

@@

![my corne keyboard](/corne.jpeg)
I built this puppy. Use it with a magic trackpad
I'm currently using a QWERTY layout with a few custom layers.
I do want to move to something more deliberate like Dvorak or Colemen
I want to design my own. Based on the apple magic keyboard, specifically how low profile it is. It feels like it's apart of the desk
